/**
 * <p>
 * This package assumes that there are external (meaning not readily connected
 * to universAAL) networking-enabled HW/SW components to which we may need
 * access in a universAAL network. As an LLDI-based approach, this package
 * refines the LDDI abstraction layer the following way based on the assumption
 * that all component type specific models will be provided in term of
 * ontologies on which the access and integration layers will rely:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <img src="./doc-files/layers.png" width="600" alt="refinement of te LDDI
 * abstraction layer">
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As can be seen in the above figure, the main elements in this framework are
 * {@link org.universAAL.lddi.abstraction.CommunicationGateway communication
 * gateways}, {@link org.universAAL.lddi.abstraction.ComponentIntegrator
 * component integrators},
 * {@link org.universAAL.lddi.abstraction.ExternalComponent external
 * components}, and component type specific ontologies (there are also
 * {@link org.universAAL.lddi.abstraction.ExternalDatapoint external datapoints}
 * as an additional concept that is not included in this package info).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As indicated by the figure above, this package has a universAAL-specific
 * view; in particular, the abstraction layer of LDDI exists in this package
 * virtually in terms of a set of relevant ontologies that can be chosen to
 * serve as the contract between the communication gateways and the component
 * integrators with regard to whatever is component type specific.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As opposed to component integrators, the extent of dependency of
 * communication gateways to universAAL can be limited to the usage of
 * {@link org.universAAL.middleware.container.Container universAAL containers}.
 * This dependency is needed so that the implemented gateway can be shared
 * within the container using
 * {@link org.universAAL.middleware.container.Container#shareObject( org.universAAL.middleware.container.ModuleContext, Object, Object[])
 * the container's shareObject method}. On the other side, component integrators
 * must fetch gateways already shared within the container using
 * {@link org.universAAL.middleware.container.Container#fetchSharedObject( org.universAAL.middleware.container.ModuleContext, Object[], org.universAAL.middleware.container.SharedObjectListener)}
 * so that in addition they are notified whenever new communication gateways are
 * shared within the container. Component integrators are then expected to
 * register the found gateways using
 * {@link org.universAAL.lddi.abstraction.CommunicationGateway#register(String, ComponentIntegrator)
 * the related method of the gateway}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Important note: the above implies that with this approach, the interplay of
 * gateways and integrators will work only when they are deployed within the
 * same universAAL container in order to be able to effectively integrate
 * external components into a given universAAL network.
 * </p>
