/**
 * <p>
 * An external component is a hard- or software component that is outside the
 * universAAL network and can be reached via a {@link CommunicationGateway
 * gateway}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class should be created only by instances of
 * {@link CommunicationGateway}. The gateway that have created an instance can
 * be fetched by calling {@link #getGateway()}, which is important for the
 * instances of {@link ComponentIntegrator} when they are notified by gateways
 * about the existence of external components.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support gateways in mapping the ontological way of "addressing" in
 * universAAL to the kind of addressing in the external network, this class
 * provides the methods {@link #addPropMapping(String, ExternalDatapoint)} and
 * {@link #getDatapoint(String)} in terms of mapping ontological properties to
 * read- and writable datapoints. Gateways are expected to use this class as
 * means for grouping external datapoints that correspond to a distinct
 * component of a distinct type. Then, in each external component, all
 * properties mapped to the selected group of external datapoints must be
 * defined for that type in the used ontology. This type must be set by gateways
 * and can be fetched by calling {@link #getTypeURI()}. Thinking in terms of
 * devices, this means that all properties must belong to a single device whose
 * type is returned by {@link #getTypeURI()}.
